<h1>Blindsplay</h1>
<p><!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- --><pre>
	A loud alarm breaks the silence of the night, roaring through the city. All kinds
of patrol vehicles swarm the city street. Admist the chaos, below the shadow,
a little guy, Lupin, is walking amongst the crowd, under disguise, blending in.

	He appears to be holding something, a cybernetic, of unknown purpose.
after a while, he disappears into the alleys, never to be seen again.

	A few days passed, Rarth has been tasked to hunt the intruders who've stolen
their cybernetics, dead or alive. Through restless investigation, and a few
interogation, Rarth is led to a guy, named Lupin Scarf.

	He arrived on one of the Dark Alleys that he has been informed on about
a meeting happening, involving Lupin

		===

	Rarth asked Lupin about the cybernetics he stole that night. Lupin tried to
run, but eventually Rarth got into him. Lupin almost fell off a building but
Rarth saved him.

	Rarth let Lupin go in exchange of the cybernetic and informations about it.
Not that it matters much, Lupin has duplicates of the cybernetic hidden at few
places.

	The cybernetics contains a code that bypass most security around the city.
Corrupted members of the Collective has been selling it to organizations of the
underworld. Giving them access to places that they're not supposed to.
Surveillance, Private informations, Blackmails.

	They're helping the Criminal organizations, so crime would flourish and
They would keep getting paid for destroying what they've kept on building.
They're pretending, they're playing blind.
