<h1>Wolf Under Sheep's Clothing</h1>

	She didn't come this time, I tried to call her several times but she did
not answer. Something might've happened to her. I need to find her quickly.

	I came to her house. Nobody's home, not even her mother, though that
doesn't surprise me. I probed into a camera nearby, she gone to college,
never went back. Now I'm worried.

	I came to her college. Of course, it's empty. Probed a camera nearby,
saw her come in, found it, it's her! Someone's kidnapping her!

	She was dragged to a truck nearby, ran a scan through it's id plate
and I found the truck! It's moving around the city, I was able to track it
thanks to the Collective's surveillance camera. It's going near the
abandoned parts of the city. There's not much camera in there, I can't
lose it, this is my only chance.

	I followed the truck across the city, and it arrived to what appears
to be an abandoned hotel. They're dragging people inside. She's one of
them!

	I followed them inside, to what appears to be, an abandoned
swimming pool? It's water suddenly drains revealing a hidden entrance
down under.

	Rarth also there, what is he doing? Doesn't matter, I need to find her
and get her out of here.

	I went inside, walking behind Rarth. Rarth encounters Lake, while I
'm gone looking for her. I found her caged amongst several other and
freed her.

	Rarth and Lake fought, though Lake managed to defeat Rarth near the
end, I managed to knock Lake out with a shock.

	Rarth appears to have been injected with Overload. Poor guy lost
his whole career.

	As for Rarth, I managed to drag him out, and hid him in the sewers.
I owe him for letting me go the last time we met.
