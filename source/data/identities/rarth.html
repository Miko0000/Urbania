	<div class="backstory">Backstory<pre class="value"> Rarth grew up as a street kid since his parents were murdered due to a connection with a gang. Because of being forced into this lifestyle, he learned how to provide for himself and deal with the everyday chaos in the city. Surprisingly he was able to survive those years and was later offered a job in the Urbania's Collective, finally being able to become part of normal society... although the Collective is widely hated throughout the public so he tends to keep his identity secret. He still carries a lot of wounds from his past life affecting his personality and overall mental health. 

No longer working for the Collective

	<div class="special">Special<div class="value"> After being injected with a full dose of overload, Rarth's cybernetics and genetics changed causing his body to work in an unnatural way - producing unstable amounts of adrenaline compared to a new human causing him to enter 'god mode' (not literally) in every such situation. (The ability isn't manually controlled by Rarth)
The downfall to this are multiple health problems and the possibility of him fainting after this takes place.
