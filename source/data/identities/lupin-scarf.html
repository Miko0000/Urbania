		<p>
				Lupin Scarf was born outside of Urbania amongst the poor.
			His mother died when he was born and his father left him. He struggles
			to live scavenging the garbage yard, sought to gain most of
			what he found, thrown out Books, Tools, Electronics.
		</p>
		<p>
				Electronics, filled with wonders and puzzles mixed by thousands
			of minds, made Lupin fall in love with it.  Led with great interest and
			guided by the circuits, he spent his life studying Electronics, from
			simpler things to more advanced form.
		</p>
		<p>
				He travels from place to place, learning more and more,
			until he stumbled upon something, a city, the great Urbania, filled
			with advanced electronics, is a Diamond to Lupin's eye.
		</p>
		<p>
				With careful planning and almost perfect execution, Lupin
			manages to enter the city arguably undetected. Ready to learn
			everything Urbania has to offer.
		</p>
			===
		<p>
				Lupin spent his time in Urbania learning everything, in
			any way. Occasionally getting into trouble with the authorities
			for tampering, stealing, or destroying Urbania's property.
		</p>
		<p>
				He also sells tools, electronics, robots, guides, hacks, as
			part of trade, though most of it is in no way special, some of them
			is good enough to attract the Collective's interest.
